#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The install script installs scale package files that have already been
# downloaded to the src sub-directory of the current working directory
# (src/pidacs).
#
# Before starting, install checks to see if the the papamaclib package has
# already been downloaded.  If not, it aborts the installation.  If so, it
# replaces the link to papamaclib in src/pidacs with a valid link to
# src/papamaclib.
#
# To install the PiDACS package, the script marks the hx711.py and scale.py
# files as executable and creates symbolic links to these executables in the
# bin sub-directory of the current working directory.
#
# install does not install or start the scale daemon (scaled).  Use the option
# script to do this after the install is complete.
#
# install is designed to be used with papamac's personal package utility
# (p2pkg).  The PiDACS package is downloaded to the current working directory
# using ftp (p2pkg -f) or git (p2pkg -g) and then installed (p2pkg -i).  Usage
# examples are as follows:
#
# p2pkg -fi scale                       # Download the scale package from the
#                                         ftp server and install it in the
#                                         current working directory.
# cd /usr/local                         # Download the scale package from
# sudo p2pkg -gi scale                    github and install it in /usr/local.
